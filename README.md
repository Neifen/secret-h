# Secret-H Voting Helper

A Go and HTMX web application to streamline voting and execution mechanics in the *Secret-H* board game. This app ensures synchronized chancellor voting and clear confirmation of eliminations, replacing physical cards and reducing ambiguity.

## Features
- **Synchronized Voting**: Ensures all players vote for the chancellor simultaneously.
- **Clear Execution Confirmation**: Confirms whether a player has been eliminated, removing uncertainty.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Built with HTMX for dynamic, responsive interactions without page reloads.
- **Dockerized Deployment**: Easy setup and deployment using Docker.

## Prerequisites
- Docker (for running the application)
- A modern web browser for accessing the app
